Ezio loves automation. He is quite lazy and is getting tired of opening the Cyberoam Portal everytime when  he has to connect to the internet. So, one weekend he sits down & writes a python script to **auto login** into cyberoam.

And  after a few hours of coding, **Boom!!** Now all he has to do is run the script and the internet's up and running.


### Usage  Instructions
Clone  the files to your desktop & run the following commands
* to login:  ```$ python cyberoam-auto-login login```
* to logout: ```$ python cyberoam-auto-login logout```
